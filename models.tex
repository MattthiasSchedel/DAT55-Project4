\subsection{Deep Learning Models}\label{sec:dl-models}
Besides the Machine Learning models from section \ref{sec:models}, we want to implement Deep Learning models. Previous work has shown that RoBERTa could reach an accuracy of 86.72\% on the ADReSS challenge dataset \cite{aslaksen2020diagnosis}. 

RoBERTa is a special case of BERT. Both are pre-trained large language models, based on the transformer architecture \cite{liu2019roberta, Devlin2019BERTPO}.
