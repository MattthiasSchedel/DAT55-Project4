    "Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs on downstream datasets results in huge performance gains when compared to using the pretrained LLMs out-of-the-box. However, as models get larger and larger, full fine-tuning becomes infeasible to train on consumer hardware. In addition, storing and deploying fine-tuned models independently for each downstream task becomes very expensive, because fine-tuned models are the same size as the original pretrained model. Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches are meant to address both problems!"
